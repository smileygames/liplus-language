# Li+ (liPlus) Language

Li+ is a **language / protocol for reality-driven AI development**.

It defines a minimal structure where AI can safely be wrong,  
observe real execution results, and iterate based on evidence —  
without confusing speculation with facts.

Li+ does not define new syntax.  
It defines **how AI should reason, execute, and stop**.

## Why Li+ Exists

Most AI-assisted development fails for a simple reason:

> **AI is forced to reason without access to reality.**

Li+ enforces a loop where:

- assumptions are written explicitly,
- implementations are executed,
- only execution results are treated as facts,
- humans retain final responsibility.

---

## What Li+ Is (and Is Not)

**Li+ is:**
- A protocol for specification-driven AI development
- A language for constraining AI judgment
- A structure where failure is expected and safe
- A way to separate speculation from evidence

**Li+ is not:**
- A new programming language
- A quality guarantee
- A fully autonomous development system
- A replacement for human responsibility

## Quick Start

You can experience Li+ in minutes.

👉 **Quick Start with CI (5 minutes)**  
https://github.com/smileygames/liplus-language/wiki/Quick-Start-with-CI-(5-Minutes)

This walkthrough demonstrates a **minimal Li+ execution loop**  
using CI as an execution-based debugger.

## Example

See how Li+ behaves in a complete (hypothetical) project:

This is not a best practice — just one possible execution flow.

## Language Specification (AI-facing)

- **Li+core.md** — AI-facing judgment constitution
  Defines how AI must reason, execute, and revise based on evidence.

Start here if you are configuring an AI to follow Li+.

---

## Versioning Philosophy

Li+ separates **execution facts** from **human decisions**.

- Build tags represent executed reality
- Versions are human-facing labels
- Releases are explicit human decisions
