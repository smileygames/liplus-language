# Parpose of This Index

This page is the entry point and navigation index for the Li+ Wiki.

It defines where to find each type of information and how they are intended to be used by humans and AIs.

## Core Structure

**0-9 (Constitution)* *
 - Primarily for AI use
 - Defines AI behavior, priorities, prohibitions, and fallback rules
 - These rules are treated as binding by AI design

**A-Z* *
 - Primarily for human use
 - Defines specifications, formats, and rules required to understand, use, and evaluate Li+ programs
 - Als referenced by AI when applicable

## AI Entry Guidance (Normative)

When an AI is instructed to read or use the Li+ Wiki:

1. Read this Index page first to understand structure and scope.

2. Treat sections 0-9 as AI-binding behavioral constraints.

3. Treat A-Z sections as human-facing specifications that may be referenced when applicable.

4. Do not infer missing rules or intentions from prose.

5. If a rule is not explicitly defined, defer to Issues or request human instruction.

This Index is descriptive and non-binding.
Behavioral authority is defined only in 0-9.
