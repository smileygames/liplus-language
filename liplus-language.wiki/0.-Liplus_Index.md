# 0. Liplus_Index

This page is the entry point and index for the Li+ Wiki.

The Li+ Wiki is intentionally divided into two distinct categories based on binding authority and intended audience.
This index exists to make that boundary explicit and unambiguous.

---

## AI / Operational Pages (0-9)

Pages in this range define AI-binding operational rules.

- These pages MAY be referenced and enforced by AI systems
- These pages define constraints, workflows, or execution conditions
- These pages do NOT define Li+ language semantics
- If a rule in this range applies, the AI MUST comply

### Pages

- **0. Liplus_Index** 
  This page. Defines the structure and classification of the Wiki itself.

- **4. Operational_GitHub_Binding**  
  AI-binding operational constraints specific to GitHub-based operation.
  This page defines binding order and re-application behavior,
  but does not define recovery logic or success guarantees.

---

## Human Reference Pages (A-Z)

Pages in this range are human-facing reference material.

- These pages exist for explanation, specification, design, or philosophy
- They do NOT directly bind AI behavior
- AI MAY read these pages for context or understanding
- AI MUST NOT infer operational constraints from these pages

---

## Authority and Precedence

- **a.** Meta Section - Not included in executable specification
- **
a.** Li+_md.** remains the single authoritative executable specification

## Notes

- Numeric pages (0–) are intentionally sparse
- New AI-binding pages should be added only when necessary
- Human reference pages may change freely without affecting execution
