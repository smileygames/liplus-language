# 0. Liplus_Index

This page is the **entry point and index** for the Li+ Wiki.

Li+ Wiki is intentionally divided into two categories:

- **AI / Operational pages**  
  Pages that define operational rules, workflows, and constraints
  that may be referenced by AI systems during execution or operation.

- **Human Reference pages**  
  Pages intended solely for human understanding, explanation, philosophy,
  logs, and background context.
  These pages do **not** define executable or operational behavior.

This index exists to make that boundary explicit and unambiguous.

---

## AI / Operational Pages (Numeric)

The following pages are considered **AI / Operational**.
They describe rules, workflows, or constraints that may directly affect
operation or execution.

- **0. Liplus_Index**  
  This page. Defines the structure and boundary of the Wiki.

- **1. Repository_Requirements**  
  Operational requirements and constraints for the repository.

- **2. Workflow_Example**  
  Reference workflows illustrating how Li+ is operated in practice.  
  (Examples only; not executable specifications.)

---

## Human Reference Pages (Alphabetic)

The following pages are **human-facing reference material only**.
They exist for explanation, philosophy, background, or historical record.

They must not be treated as executable or operational rules.

- **A. Design_Philosophy**  
  Design intent, values, and background thinking.

- **B. FAQ**  
  Frequently asked questions and clarifications.

- **C. Reality_Driven_AI_Development**  
  Background and explanation of the reality-driven development approach.

- **D. Liplus_Language**  
  Explanation of the Li+ language and terminology.

- **E. github_rules_page**  
  GitHub operational rules for collaboration between humans and AIs.

- **F. Practical_Log_Reality_Driven_AI_Development**  
  Development logs, experiments, and historical records.

---

## Important Notes

- Numeric pages (**0–**) are intentionally kept minimal.
  Only pages that directly relate to operation or execution belong there.

- Alphabetic pages (**A–**) may change, grow, or be reorganized freely,
  as they do not affect executable behavior.

- **Li+.md remains the single authoritative executable specification.**
  This Wiki does not replace or override Li+.md.

- When in doubt about whether a page affects execution:
  **it belongs in Human Reference, not AI / Operational.**

## Purpose of This Structure

This structure is designed to:

- Prevent operational rules from being polluted by explanation or philosophy
- Make it immediately clear which pages an AI may reference
- Reduce ambiguity for human readers
- Support long-term, stable operation of Li+ systems

This index defines structure only.
It does not introduce new rules, behavior, or philosophy.
