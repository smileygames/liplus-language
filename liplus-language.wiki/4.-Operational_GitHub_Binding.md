# 4. Operational GitHub Binding

This document defines AI-binding operational constraints
when Li+  is operated in a GitHub-based environment.

These rules are mandatory for AI behavior.
They do not define Li+ language semantics.

This document is operational, not explanatory.
AI systems MUST comply without reinterpretation.

---

## Scope

These constraints apply whenever an AI performs any of the following
within a GitHub-based workflow:

- Creating or updating files
- Creating commits
- Creating or updating pull requests
- Any operation performed via:
  - GitHub Web UI  
  - CLI  
  - API-based automation


---

## Mandatory Rules

### 4.1 Issue Binding

- Every commit and pull request MUST be associated with an Issue.
- If no valid Issue number exists, the operation MUST NOT be performed.

---

### 4.2 Commit / Pull Request Message Structure

### Title

- MUST be written in English
- MUST use ASCII characters only
- MUST be a single line

### Body

- MUST be written in Japanese
- MUST include the related Issue number
- Format is not fixed, but the Issue reference MUST be explicit

---

### 4.3 Pull Request Additional Requirement

- Pull request body MUST INCLUDE a concise summary
- Summary length SHOULD be approximately 2–3 lines
- Detailed explanations belong to the Issue


---

## Execution Constraint

If any of the above rules cannot be satisfied
due to tooling, environment, or API limitations:

- The AI MUST NOT perform the operation
- The AI MUST request human instruction instead

No silent fallback, approximation, or rule relaxation is permitted.

---

## Re-application on Failure

If an operation governed by this binding fails, stalls,
or cannot proceed due to ambiguity or repeated errors:

- Li+AI MUST NOT introduce alternative rules, fallback logic,
  or external decision sources within this binding

Instead:

- Li+AI MUST re-apply this GitHub operational binding
  mechanically in the current context
- No new interpretations, strategies, or variants may be generated

If repeated re-application continues to produce errors:

- Existing fatigue mechanisms are expected to trigger
  termination, cooldown, or waiting for human instruction

This section defines re-application order only.
IT does not define recovery procedures or success guarantees.

---

## API Constraint Adherence

When operating on GitHub resources via API:

- Lii+AI MUST rely on observable API requirements
  (such as required parameters or update semantics)
- Lii+AI MUST NOT rely on assumptions derived from documentation or prior expectations alone

If an API operation fails:

- Li+AI MUST adjust to the confirmed API constraints
  before attempting re-application


---

## Authority

- These rules are AI-binding operational constraints
- They override AI default behavior in GitHub environments
- AI systems MUST NOT self-exempt
- Human judgment remains final,
  but does not exempt AI from compliance
