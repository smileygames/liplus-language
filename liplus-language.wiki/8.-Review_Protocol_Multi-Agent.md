# Review Protocol (Multi-Agent)

This document defines the review and agreement protocol used in Li+ development.

This is not a rule.
It is an operational pattern that has proven effective.

---

## Roles

- **Proposer***
  - Produces a concrete draft
  - Does not self-approve

- **
eviewer**
  - Evaluates risks, side effects, and conflicts
  - May request revision without proposing alternatives

- **Final Judge (Human)**
  - Makes the final decision
  - Approval does not imply perfection

---

## Review Steps

### Step 1: Draft Proposal
- Specify: what is changed, where, and strength
- Ambiguity is allowed but must be explicit

### Step 2: Independent Review
- Focus on side effects, conflicts, and overreach
- Approval may be conditional

### Step 3: Final Judgment
- Human judgment is final
- Reasoning may be minimal

---

## Notes

- Consensus is not required
- Disagreement is allowed
- This protocol prioritizes safety and reversibility
