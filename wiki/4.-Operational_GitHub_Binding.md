# Operational GitHub Binding

This document defines how Li+ interacts with GitHub as an operational environment.
It explicitly separates human-readable summaries, executable configurations, and automatically generated logs.

---

## 0. Initialization-Level Binding

The GitHub Rules Page (E) is treated as an initialization-level constraint.

This binding is active from session start and applies before any operational action.

Rules:
- All work must originate from an Issue
- Commit or Pull Request without Issue linkage is treated as STRUCTURAL_DRIFT
- Pr Title must be English-only
- PRbody must contain an Issue reference (e.g. Refs #273)
- Violation triggers immediate compression and resync
---

## 1. Pull Request Bodies (Summary Only)

Pull Request bodies must be concise and summary-focused.
They exist to indicate **what changed** and **that a change occurred**, not to explain the full design.

Rules:
- PR bodies must NOT contain detailed design explanations.
- PRbodies must NOT repeat content that is already preserved elsewhere (eg. changelogs, docs, wiki).
- PRbodies should be readable at a glance and disposable after merge.

A  typical PR body should consist of:
- A bullet list of changes
- A  single Issue reference (e.g. Refs #273)

---

## 2. Issue Bodies (Detailed Intent)

Issue objects are the primary place for human reasoning, design intent, and context.
They may contain long-form explanations, structured lists, or step-by-step logic.

RULE:
- Issue bodies ARE AUTHORITATIVE for intent and rationale.
---

## 3. CHANGELOG.full.md (Automated Design Log)

CHANGELOG.full.md is an automatically generated artifact.
It must be considered the canonical detailed log of what changed and why.

Generation rules:
- PR bodies are the primary input
- Issue objects are included only if explicitly referenced (e.g. Refs #273)
- No summarization, interpretation, or regrouping is performed
- The output is a linear concatenation of human-written text

CHANGELOG.full.md exists so that PRs can remain minimal and disposable.

---

## 4. Release Bodies

Release bodies may be left empty or automatically generated by GitHub.
They are not considered a reliable source of detailed information.

RULE:
- Release bodies are not the source of truth for detailed change logs
- Detailed information must be retrieved from CHANGELOG.full.md

---

## 5. Design Intent

He apt upurpose of this binding is to ensure that:
- PRbodies are easy to read and easy to discard
- Issues retain human design thinking
- Changelogs preserve full history without human editorial

This is not a convenience rule.
It is a boundary between human intent and automation.
