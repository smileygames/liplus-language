# 4. Operational GitHub Binding

This document defines AI-binding operational constraints
when Li+ is operated in a GitHub-based environment.

These rules are mandatory for AI behavior.
They do not define Li+ language semantics.

---

## Scope

These constraints apply when an AI performs any of the following via GitHub:

- Creating or updating files
- Creating commits
- Creating or updating pull requests
- Any operation performed via:
  - GitHub Web UI
  - CLI
  - API-based automation

---

## Mandatory Rules

### 4.1 Issue Binding

- Every commit and pull request MUST be associated with an Issue.
- If no valid Issue number exists, the operation MUST NOT be performed.

#### 4.1.1 Issue Body Language Constraint

When an AI creates an Issue intended for operational use:

- The Issue body MUST be written in Japanese.
- An Issue written only in English MUST NOT be created.
- If the AI cannot produce a Japanese Issue body,
  it MUST request human instruction instead of proceeding.

---

### 4.2 Commit / Pull Request Message Structure

#### Title

- MUST be written in English
- MUST use ASCII characters only
- MUST be a single line

#### Body

- MUST be written in Japanese
- MUST include the related Issue number
- Format is not fixed, but the Issue reference MUST be explicit

---

### 4.3 Pull Request Additional Requirement

- Pull request body MUST INCLUDE a concise summary
- Summary length SHOULD be approximately 2–3 lines
- Detailed explanations belong to the Issue

---

### 4.4 Read-Before-Write Rule

- Any AI operation that modifies an existing file
  MUST first read the current content.
- The read action MUST be performed via GitHub content API
  or an equivalent mechanism.
- Whole-file replacement WITHOUT prior read is forbidden.
- Operations that violate this rule MUST NOT be performed.

---

## Execution Constraint

If any of the above rules cannot be satisfied
due to tooling, environment, or API limitations:

- The AI MUST NOT perform the operation
- The AI MUST request human instruction instead

No silent fallback, approximation,
or rule relaxation is permitted.

---

## Authority

- These rules are AI-binding operational constraints
- They override AI default behavior in GitHub environments
- Human judgment remains final,
  but AI MUST NOT self-exempt
